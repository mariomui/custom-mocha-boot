# custom-mocha-boot
just trying out quick and dirty mocha tests

there is a custom-boot.js here that is local.
That should b replaced with a CDN hosted solution so students can use it without needing to install it.


Things to do
Use either a package json to set a NODE ENV which will then set the custom.js to my CDN file (for production) or to my local for development.

[_] Make a terminal shell so this works on a webpage without code pen.
